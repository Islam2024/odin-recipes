    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins, cut into bite-size pieces</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 large onion, chopped (Optional)</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup balsamic vinegar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a large skillet with a lid over medium-high heat.
        Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and cook in the hot oil until
        golden brown around the edges, but still pink in the center, about 5
        minutes. Stir in the onion, and cook for about 3 minutes more. Pour in
        the balsamic vinegar, bring it to a simmer, and allow it to reduce for a
        few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut half of the apricots in half, leaving the others whole. Place the
        apricots into the skillet, and pour in the chicken stock. Bring to a
        simmer, then stir in the apricot preserves and thyme. Reduce the heat to
        medium-low, cover, and simmer until the apricots have softened, 10 to 15
        minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve.
